# Farm Deck (Work In Progress)

My first game, made in [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), it's a deckbuilding game where the deck is built via farming.

## Game Mechanics

- Start with some starter seeds and a farm
- Plant your seeds, grow and harvest the crops
- Harvesting crops unlock new cards
- Use the cards to build a deck
- Challenge a dungeon
- Monsters drop seeds as loots.
- Plant the new seeds and unlock new crops and cards
